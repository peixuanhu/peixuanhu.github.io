# Item 32: Combine generics and varargs judiciously

Recall from Item 28 that a non-reifiable type is one whose runtime representa- tion has less information than its compile-time representation, and that **nearly all generic and parameterized types are non-reifiable**. 

If **a method declares its varargs parameter to be of a non-reifiable type**, the compiler generates a warning on the declaration. If **the method is invoked on varargs parameters whose inferred type is non-reifiable**, the compiler generates a warning on the invocation too. The warnings look something like this:

```java
warning: [unchecked] Possible heap pollution from
       parameterized vararg type List<String>
```

> *Heap pollution* occurs when a variable of a parameterized type refers to an object that is not of that type. It can cause the compilerâ€™s automatically generated casts to fail, violating the fundamental guarantee of the generic type system.

Example:

```java
// Mixing generics and varargs can violate type safety! 
static void dangerous(List<String>... stringLists) {
  List<Integer> intList = List.of(42);
  Object[] objects = stringLists;
  objects[0] = intList; // Heap pollution 
  String s = stringLists[0].get(0); // ClassCastException
}
```

**It is unsafe to store a value in a generic varargs array parameter.**
